# ðŸŒ€ Galactic Core Black Hole Theory

## â–  Overview

This repository presents an integrated theory that redefines traditional black hole and neutron star limit theories, based on the D-axis structural model.

The galactic core black hole is not a simple gravitational object formed by mass alone.  
Instead, it is a gravitational transfer structure composed of point A (compression origin) and point D (magnetic neutron star) within the D-axis framework.  
Although it appears as a black hole observationally, its true nature is a paired structure involving an unobservable neutron star (point D).

This theory resolves several observational and theoretical contradictions:

- Why neutron stars become "unobservable" beyond 2.35 solar masses  
- Why a black hole exists at the center of a galaxy  
- The true nature of the "void regions" inside galactic structures  
- The causal structure of pressure-driven magnetic body selection during galaxy formation

## â–  Theoretical Background

The theory is constructed in the following stages:

1. **Establishment of the D-Axis Structure Theory**  
â€ƒ(Point A: absorption origin / Point D: output neutron star)

2. **Reinterpretation of the Big Bang**  
â€ƒ(The origin of the universe as "matter dispersion into negative space" due to D-axis collapse)

3. **Pressure-Driven Selection During Galaxy Formation**  
â€ƒ(Concentration of pressure at the center and the resulting evolution into magnetic bodies)

4. **Structural Definition of Galactic Core Black Holes**  
â€ƒ(A-point and D-point paired structure sustaining the central black hole appearance)

5. **Reconstruction of Neutron Star Observability Limits**  
â€ƒ(Unobservability of D-point neutron stars with 400 solar masses and 92m diameter)

## â–  Repository Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `structure.md`: Relationship between A/D gravitational structure and galaxy morphology
- `implications.md`: Verification and reinterpretation against conventional theories
- `observations.md`: Comparison with existing observational data and hypothesis consistency
- `simulation/`: Gravitational tensor simulations and structural validation
- `references.md`: Reference materials, terminology, and related theoretical links
