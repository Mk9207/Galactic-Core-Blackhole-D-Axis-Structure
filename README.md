# Galactic Core Black Hole Structure with D-Axis Integration

---

## ðŸ”­ Overview

This repository redefines the phenomenon of black holes observed at the centers of galaxies not as traditional "singularities," but as a result of compression structures formed by D-axis convergence, based on the E-TIM gravitational model.

In this framework, the center of a galaxy is not its origin but a convergence point where information from the expanding universe is compacted. This point, termed the "D point," is assumed to end in a magnetic body, typically a neutron star, which absorbs the compressive energy flow.

## ðŸ“Œ Core Concepts

- Galaxy formation does not originate from a central point, but from the aggregation of expanded information.
- Information flows converge along the tensor-aligned D-axis, forming compression cores.
- The black hole at the center is a result of this multi-axis compression converging toward a magnetic terminal.
- Neutron stars are assumed to exist along the D-axis, though often unobservable from our visible spectrum.

## ðŸ§  Notes

This model diverges from traditional gravitational and singularity-based theories. It is built entirely upon the E-TIM framework and D-axis mechanics, confirming structural consistency and observational reproducibility without invoking classical gravity assumptions.
