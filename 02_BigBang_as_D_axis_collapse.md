## Big Bang as D-Axis Collapse Theory

### Overview
The Big Bang, traditionally described as the explosive birth of the universe from a single point, is redefined in this theory as the **collapse of the D-axis structure**. The D-axis structure is a one-way material transfer system from a black hole (point A) to a neutron star (point D). The dispersal phenomenon occurring when this structure reaches its end matches the observational characteristics of the Big Bang.

### End of the D-Axis Structure and Backflow
The D-axis structure transports matter from point A to point D. As matter around point A depletes, transfer pressure drops, causing a backflow phenomenon. Ultimately, point D moves toward point A, neutralizing both points and collapsing the structure. At this moment, the previously compressed matter is released and disperses into the void.

### Biphasic Dispersal
The Big Bang-like dispersal arises from the following two phases:
1. **Rapid dispersal of compressed matter from point D (nuclear-collapse-like dispersal)**
2. **Mixed dispersal involving residual matter around point A (low-density mixing)**

This dual structure explains early-universe inhomogeneities and regions of localized high density.

### Dispersal Pressure Exceeding Light Speed
Dispersal from the compressed space (point D) into the void is not general expansion but a "reversal-type release of space". This generates dispersal pressure exceeding the usual expansion rate and matches the scale of observed cosmic expansion.

### Comparison with Conventional Big Bang Theory
- Conventional Theory: Energy explosively originated from a single spacetime point.
- This Theory: Compressed matter within a pre-existing structure dispersed upon the collapse of the D-axis.

Thus, time and space were not "created", but rather "unleashed" from a pre-existing structure.

### Relation to Dark Energy
This dispersal pressure results from the reactive force of material dispersing into a negative energy space and matches the phenomenon previously interpreted as dark energy.

### Conclusion
The Big Bang is not a creative origin but a **structural release event caused by the collapse of the D-axis structure**. This theory replaces the conventional origin-of-time view with a dynamically and structurally consistent model of cosmic expansion.
