## Cosmological Integration and Structural Redefinition

---

### Overview

This section redefines dark energy, cosmic expansion, Big Bang-like phenomena, galactic magnetic fields, and the origin of cosmic structures through a unified causal chain rooted in the D-axis framework. Each phenomenon traditionally treated independently is instead explained as a dynamic transition in the state of D-axis structures.

### Unified Role of the D-Axis Structure

The D-axis structure describes the one-way material transfer from point A (black hole) to point D (neutron star). It is the foundational framework that underpins hierarchical formations from galaxies to superclusters, inherently generating magnetic fields, repulsive forces, structural pressure, and rotational dynamics.

### Collapse of the D-Axis and Causal Mechanism of Expansion

#### ✅ Pre-Collapse Stage (Transfer Failure)

When material supply to point A dries up, the transfer to point D is disrupted, breaking gravitational balance. Point A and point D then begin to attract each other, initiating a neutralization phase.

#### ✅ Neutralization of A and D / Collapse of the D-Axis

As the transfer system ceases completely, A and D merge both spatially and functionally, resulting in the collapse of the D-axis structure. The matter accumulated at point D is explosively released.

#### ✅ True Identity of Dark Energy Expansion

A void-like, negative energy region was previously formed around point A to enable compression toward D. Upon D-axis collapse, this negative energy field collapses, and matter released from D rapidly expands to fill the void. This expansion—recorded as "dark energy"—is actually the extreme negative-pressure driven reverse flow to fill the vacuum around A.

### Residual Matter and Consistency with the Early Universe

Around point A, matter not absorbed into the D-axis remained. These are structural exceptions omitted from the initial transfer phase.

After D-axis collapse, this residual matter mixes with the explosively released core matter from point D, forming the early material composition of the observable universe. However, since the residual matter did not originate from coherent D-axis dynamics, it appears observationally as "pre-Big Bang anomalies"—a conclusion supported by existing observations.

### Coherence with Cosmic Magnetism and Structure Formation

When multiple D-axis structures collapse simultaneously, magnetic paths and repulsion axes remain along the former transfer channels. These remnants are likely the origin of directional cosmic magnetic fields and filamentary structures.

The observed cosmic web is thus highly consistent with the remnant network of collapsed D-axis structures.

### Conclusion

- The collapse and neutralization of the D-axis structure is the unified origin of dark energy, cosmic expansion, primordial matter composition, and magnetic structure formation.
- The "Big Bang" is not the creation of the universe, but a structural event tied to D-axis failure.
- Anomalies like pre-Big Bang matter are consistent with the observational residue of structurally isolated matter.

D-axis theory offers a coherent, dynamic, and causal foundation for cosmological phenomena across space and time.
