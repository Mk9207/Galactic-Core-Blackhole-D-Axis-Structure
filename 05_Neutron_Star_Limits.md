## Redefinition of Neutron Star Mass Limits and Observational Misinterpretation

---

### Overview

Conventional theory asserts that the upper mass limit for neutron stars is approximately 2.35 times the mass of the Sun, and any celestial object exceeding that is classified as a black hole. However, this assertion conflates observational limitations with physical boundaries, resulting in misclassification. In truth, neutron stars exceeding 2.35 solar masses likely exist but are difficult to observe.

This document redefines the limit based on D-axis theory and resolves observational contradictions while maintaining structural consistency.

### Basis and Misinterpretation in Conventional Theory

**Claim of conventional theory:**

Neutron stars collapse into black holes when their mass exceeds 2.35 solar masses. This is based on the Chandrasekhar limit and the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit.

**Issues:**

The lack of observations of neutron stars above 2.36 solar masses stems not from non-existence but from observational limitations.

Objects that reflect no light and are too small to emit detectable gravitational waves are currently beyond detection capability.

### Interpretation from D-Axis Theory: The Existence of Unobservable Neutron Stars

According to D-axis theory, the neutron star D-point is the endpoint of a compression path from the A-point.

As matter accumulates at the D-point, its mass increases and diameter shrinks, allowing for a convergence of up to 400 times solar mass into a 92-meter diameter.

Such objects, unless precisely centered, become virtually unobservable “observational black boxes.”

The conclusion: Neutron stars exceeding 2.36 solar masses do exist, but are practically undetectable.

### Consistency with Galactic Center Black Holes

The black holes observed at galactic centers may, in reality, be neutron star D-points.

In D-axis theory, a neutron star selected during galaxy formation under sustained pressure becomes a D-point.

Its mass and contracted diameter result in it being observed as a black hole, while its internal structure follows the D-axis model.

This allows for a unified interpretation: “Observed as black hole = Structurally a neutron star.”

### Conclusion

The upper limit of neutron star mass is a function of observability, not physical possibility.

D-axis theory structurally resolves this misinterpretation, enabling unified understanding of:

- Observational misclassification
- The true nature of galactic centers
- Skewed distribution of neutron stars
