# Galactic Core Blackhole Theory

## Overview

This theory expands the D-axis structure to the galactic formation scale, reinterpreting the observed phenomenon known as the “galactic core black hole” from a structural perspective involving the neutron star D.

## Galactic Formation and Pressure Structure

As matter disperses in the universe and begins gravitational aggregation, a structure concentrating pressure at the gravitational center is formed. With the formation and expansion of multiple celestial bodies, the earliest formed body ends up at the center, receiving the full gravitational pressure and triggering nuclear fusion, resulting in the formation of the black hole A-point.

## D-axis Formation at Galactic Scale

Once an A-point emerges, a corresponding magnetic body (neutron star D-point) is selected, forming a D-axis structure. At the galactic scale, the pressure is orders of magnitude greater than at the normal scale, resulting in a D-point formed from celestial-scale magnetic bodies. This leads to neutron stars with extreme characteristics, such as 400 times the solar mass and a diameter of 92 meters.

## Observed Blackholes vs. Actual D-axis

Only the A-point black hole is detectable through high-energy emissions or gravitational lensing. In contrast, the D-point neutron star, due to its minuscule size, high density, and positional uncertainty, remains unobservable. This leads to a misinterpretation of the entire D-axis structure as a “black hole.”

## “Void Space” and the D-point

So-called void regions within galaxies are, in fact, areas where D-axis relay points did not form or where the D-point neutron star became so extremely compressed that it exited visible ranges. The center of these voids likely hosts an unobservable D-point neutron star.

## Galactic Structure and D-axis Selection

Due to the properties of the D-axis structure, while the A-point settles at the galactic center, the D-point is a selected magnetic body located somewhere within the galaxy. The distribution of mass and voids within a galaxy directly reflects the D-axis's selection and reconstruction history.

## Conclusion

The Galactic Core Blackhole Theory redefines the observed black hole structures based on the D-axis framework, providing consistent explanations for:

- The true nature of the observed A-point black hole,
- The existence of an unobservable D-point neutron star,
- The causal reasons behind void regions within galaxies.

The D-axis structure operates even at the galactic scale, offering a theoretically consistent framework that reinterprets observational misidentifications.
