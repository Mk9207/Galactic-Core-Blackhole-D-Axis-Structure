## Galactic Gravitational Structure and Its Broad Influence

---

### Overview

The galactic central black hole (A-point structure) is the concentrated endpoint of gravitational energy compressed and aggregated via the D-axis structure. It also serves as the origin of the gravitational framework that governs the entire galaxy. This central structure dynamically regulates stars, planets, gas clouds, and dark matter throughout the galactic region.

### Gravitational Control on a Galactic Scale

While the A-point at the galactic center governs the overall gravitational control of the galaxy, its essential role is not as a gravity source, but as a convergence point for transferring matter to the D-point.

As matter continues to flow into the A-point, the structure of the galaxy is maintained, stabilizing the placement and orbits of stars.

When matter transfer through the D-axis structure is hindered, distortions can arise within the galaxy, potentially manifesting as anomalies in rotation curves or reduced star formation rates.

### Unified Interpretation of the Rotation Curve Problem

Galactic rotation curves—where orbital velocities do not diminish with distance but remain high in the outer regions—have traditionally been explained by the presence of dark matter.

However, the D-axis structure theory explains this by the pressure from A-to-D matter transfer and the repulsive force of negative energy along the transfer path, resulting in stable rotational motion even in the galaxy’s outskirts.

In other words, distributed pressure and transfer directionality inherent in the D-axis structure allow the outer regions to rotate rapidly in coordination with the inner regions.

### Galaxy Morphology, Magnetic Fields, and Intergalactic Interactions

The D-axis structure forms multiple transfer paths (including relay points) from the A-point to the D-point, giving rise to spiral and bar-like structures in galaxies.

The arrangement of magnetic bodies along these paths underpins the galactic magnetic field, stabilizing directional magnetic lines.

Gravitational and tidal interactions with other galaxies can also be reconstructed via the D-axis structure, enabling the integration of galactic formation models into a unified framework.

### Conclusion

In the theory of galactic central black holes, the D-axis structure functions not simply as a gravitational center, but as a core system for matter transfer, convergence, and magnetic structuring. Through this, phenomena such as galactic stability, rotation curves, magnetic field generation, and intergalactic interactions—previously handled in fragmented models—can now be consistently redefined within a coherent dynamical and structural framework.
