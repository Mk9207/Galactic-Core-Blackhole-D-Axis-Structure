# D-axis Structure Theory

## Overview

The D-axis structure is a unidirectional energy system that governs the movement, compression, and reconfiguration of matter in the universe, connecting black holes (Point A) and neutron stars (Point D). This structure integrates negative energy space, compression pathways, and repulsive/attractive/magnetic forces, forming the backbone of cosmic formation, expansion, and restructuring.

## Point A (Black Hole)

Point A acts as the starting point, absorbing external matter and transferring it unidirectionally toward Point D, observed as a black hole. The gravitational pull observed here is, in fact, a result of the complex flow involving repulsive compression necessary for transfer and the gravitational pull from Point D. The region around Point A is a “null space” due to compression-driven matter transmission to D, where light and matter instantly reach Point D.

## Pathway Structure and Negative Energy

The transfer path from A to D includes a negative energy space paired with the positive energy (neutron star). This space has repulsive properties that push matter, instantly transferring even light. This is the true nature of the region traditionally known as a black hole.

## Point D (Neutron Star)

Point D is the endpoint where matter sent from A accumulates and compresses, converging into a magnetic entity. Matter here is compressed to its extreme, forming a high-density neutron star. As the mass of Point D increases, so does its gravitational pull, forming a stronger transfer pathway.

## Relay Points (B-C Structure)

Between A and D, there exist multiple relay points, which act as magnetic intermediaries stabilizing the D-axis structure. Though unobservable, they are structurally indispensable. These relay points appear only during events such as supernova explosions, as remnants.

## Structural Collapse and Cosmic Origin

When the matter surrounding Point A depletes, the pressure transferring matter to Point D drops, causing a reverse flow. Eventually, Point D moves toward A, neutralizing and collapsing the D-axis structure. The compressed matter explosively expands into the null space, generating expansion force exceeding the speed of light.

This phenomenon mirrors the behavior of the Big Bang. The expansion caused by the collapse of the D-axis structure, combined with residual matter around Point A, is considered the mechanism by which the universe expanded.

## Relation to Dark Energy

As matter spreads rapidly into the null space, this manifests as a repulsive force in the negative energy region. This force corresponds to what has been observed as "dark energy" — actually the expansive negative pressure during D-axis collapse.

## Conclusion

The D-axis structure theory provides a unified framework for explaining black holes, neutron stars, dark energy, and the Big Bang. The integrated structure of Point A, Point D, and relay points serves as the fundamental unit of cosmic formation and dynamic evolution, achieving both observational coherence and theoretical consistency.
